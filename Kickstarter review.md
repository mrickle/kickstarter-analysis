# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The purpose of the project was to showcase the successful, failed and canceled outcomes for theater plays and if those theater plays were successful in reaching the goals set.

### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges
I used formulas suggested like countifs but I also used concat formulas to make adding text easier.
trying to type the 10000 to 14999 and on down would have taken too much time so I seperated the text, added 1 to the back number, copied it down and concatenated the formulas to gether to get the text

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

two conclusions, one is that most theaters were successful by the launch date and very little were canceled.
I would also say that spring into summer were the most successful months while failure happened with no trend

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The higher the goal amount was the less successful the theaters were being most successful if stayed under 5000
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Limitaions of this dataset is that too much manipulation needed to take place before it could be presented. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
we could create tables showing if theaters were more successful during different years if as the years go on do theaters go out of style.
We could create a graph demonstraiting how much was raised versus if they met their goals or not.
